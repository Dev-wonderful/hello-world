# hello-world
first step

Hi there, Wonderful here, I am excited about starting something here. it is funny that it took a bug in my code to make me set this up, not because i want to share the code, but intead as a way of taking my mind off it temporarily....lol. I isolated that part of my code and debugged it, this went well as it started working as expected until i added it to the main code, a different kind of error this time.
